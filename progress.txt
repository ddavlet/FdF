my points are unsigned int, they go less than 0
my plan is first declare all iso points and than draw image for it
protect my x from going less than 0 and turn picture back
init_point function, change step
new idea! I can first initialize tiny picture with 2-3 pixels between points 
and than increase distance untill I meet some width and height
